# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

*EIN and NAME—Identification columns
*APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
*AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
*CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
*USE_CASE—Use case for funding
*ORGANIZATION—Organization type
*STATUS—Active status
*INCOME_AMT—Income classification
*SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
*ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
*IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Using my knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler, I will preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I will design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. I will then compile, train, and evaluate my binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Finally, using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I will optimize my model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. If I can't achieve an accuracy higher than 75%, I will need to make at least three attempts to do so.
